NLCD 2011 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2011. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2011 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2011 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2011 Landsat satellite data.","classDefs":[{"classVal":1,"alias":"","name":"Eau","color":"#FF005CE6","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":2,"alias":"","name":"Forets","color":"#FF009161","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":3,"alias":"","name":"Culture","color":"#FF3A30BD","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":4,"alias":"","name":"Bati","color":"#FFAE93AE","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":5,"alias":"","name":"Matoral","color":"#FFC04D11","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":6,"alias":"","name":"Sol_nu","color":"#FF0D67AF","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":7,"alias":"","name":"Culture_serre","color":"#FF275240","description":"","subclasses":[]}]}
